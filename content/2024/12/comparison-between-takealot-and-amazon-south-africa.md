Status: Published


## Introduction

I have been using Takealot for online shopping for as long
as I can remember, but Amazon recently launched in South Africa
to give Takealot some competition.  I have making been many online
purchases on both since Black Friday 2024, and have decided to
share a comparison between Takealot and Amazon South Africa
based on my personal experience of shopping from the two
of them.

## Takealot

### Pros

1. Items hardly ever arrive damaged.
2. User can immediately see the prices of items when browsing
   through the various deals pages without having to click
   through to the product page of each item.
3. The website and mobile app are both user-friendly
   and easy to navigate, and have modern UI and UX.
4. It is simple to reschedule a delivery.
5. Small items are always placed into boxes to prevent them
   from being damaged by the couriers, only large items
   that already have their own sturdy packaging are not
   placed into boxes.
6. The packaging tape on the boxes is very easy to remove.
7. The product review process uses AI to moderate the reviews
   and the review only requires manual approval if the AI
   doesn't approve the review automatically, so if the
   review guidelines are adhered to, product reviews are
   approved very quickly.
8. Delivery drivers give the user a phone call if they
   don't hear them hooting to ensure that the delivery is
   not missed.
9. Delivery handover is smooth and efficient.

### Cons

1.  Prices are often much higher than Amazon South Africa.
2.  Some merchants sell fake brand name products, for example
    Levi's, Jeep, and a few of the "Parallel import"
    perfumes.
3.  Only a single collection point in my area which is inconvenient
    and out of my way.
4.  Collections for returns cannot be rescheduled by the user.
5.  Notifications for wish list items seem to be based on price
    changes, regardless of whether the price increases or decreases.
6.  An order cannot be cancelled once the user has paid for it,
    they have to wait for it to be delivered and then schedule
    a return.
7.  The user is able to review items before they are even
    delivered.
8.  No progress bar to show the percentage of deals claimed.
9.  Excessive use of boxes by either using oversized boxes or
    placing each order item into separate boxes instead of
    packaging everything together into a single box.
10. No indication of last purchased date if the user views
    the product page for a product that they have previously
    purchased.
11. When reviewing products, the user is unable to upload
    photos or videos as part of their review.

## Amazon South Africa

### Pros

1. Prices are often much lower than Takealot.
2. Collection points use Pudo Lockers (powered by The Courier
   Guy), and there are many around me, which makes collections
   much more convenient.
3. Order items can be cancelled before the order is packed.
4. The deals page has a progress bar that shows the percentage
   of deals claimed.
5. If the user clicks through to a product page for a product
   that they have previously purchased, the page product page
   will display the date that the product was previously
   purchased, which is useful for accidentally purchasing the
   same product more than once.
6. When reviewing products, the user is able to upload a photo
   or video as part of their review.

### Cons

1.  Around 50% of the items that I ordered arrived with
    broken or damaged boxes, or even boxes that had been opened
    which is especially unacceptable when purchasing gifts.
2.  Some items are packed into soft courier bags instead of
    boxes, which causes items to be damaged by the couriers.
3.  Prices are not visible when browsing through the deals
    pages.  The user has to click though to the product page
    for each item to view the price of that specific item.
4.  The navigation on both the website and mobile app are very
    buggy and they both jump and make the user lose track of
    where they were while trying to scroll through the 
    deals pages.
5.  The UI of the page to cancel order items is hideous,
    and only allows the user to cancel the entire quantity
    instead of allowing the user to specify the quantity that
    they want to cancel.
6.  The general UI and UX are very dated and not user-friendly
    at all.
7.  The user has to fight with the packaging tape to remove it
    from the boxes.
8.  The product review process seems to be manual, so it takes
    a long time for product reviews to be approved.
9.  Delivery drivers drive off if the user does not hear them
    hooting, and also do not give the user sufficient time to
    meet them before driving off.
10. Delivery handover is slow and inefficient and requires
    a lot of patience most of the time.

## Conclusion

- Takealot is generally a far superior experience.
- Amazon South Africa has far more competitive pricing,
  especially during Black Friday.
