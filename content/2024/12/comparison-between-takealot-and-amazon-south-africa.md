Status: Published


## Introduction

I have been using Takealot for online shopping for as long
as I can remember, but Amazon recently launched in South Africa
to give Takealot some competition.  I have making been many online
purchases on both since Black Friday 2024, and have decided to
share a comparison between Takealot and Amazon South Africa
based on my personal experience of shopping from the two
of them.

## Takealot

### Pros

1.  Items hardly ever arrive damaged.
2.  Significantly larger product catalog.
3.  User can immediately see the prices of items when browsing
    through the various deals pages without having to click
    through to the product page of each item.
4.  The website and mobile app are both user-friendly
    and easy to navigate, and have modern UI and UX.
5.  It is simple to reschedule a delivery.
6.  Small items are always placed into boxes to prevent them
    from being damaged by the couriers, only large items
    that already have their own sturdy packaging are not
    placed into boxes.
7.  The packaging tape on the boxes is very easy to remove.
8.  The product review process uses AI to moderate the reviews
    and the review only requires manual approval if the AI
    doesn't approve the review automatically, so if the
    review guidelines are adhered to, product reviews are
    approved very quickly.
9.  Delivery drivers give the user a phone call if they
    don't hear them hooting to ensure that the delivery is
    not missed.
10. Delivery handover is smooth and efficient.

### Cons

1.  Prices are often much higher than Amazon South Africa.
2.  Some merchants sell fake brand name products, for example
    Levi's, Jeep, and a few of the "Parallel import"
    perfumes.
3.  Sometimes a completely different and completely unrelated
    product is delivered instead of the one that was actually
    ordered.
4.  Only a single collection point in my area which is inconvenient
    and out of my way.
5.  Collections for returns cannot be rescheduled by the user,
    until the first collection attempt has failed.
6.  Notifications for wish list items seem to be based on price
    changes, regardless of whether the price increases or decreases.
7.  There is no option to view all wish list products at once wnen
    the user has more than one wish list.  They have to browse
    though each wish list one by one.
8.  When an incorrect product is delivered, and user requests a
    replacement for the product they originally ordered, the
    replacement order is shipped to the collection address for
    the incorrect product instead of the same delivery address
    as the original order.  It would actually be better for
    the user to select a delivery address of their choice for
    the replacement order instead of Takealot making incorrect
    assumptions.
9.  An order cannot be cancelled once the user has paid for it,
    they have to wait for it to be delivered and then schedule
    a return.
10. The user is able to review items before they are even
    delivered.
11. No progress bar to show the percentage of deals claimed.
12. Excessive use of boxes by either using oversized boxes or
    placing each order item into separate boxes instead of
    packaging everything together into a single box.
13. No indication of last purchased date if the user views
    the product page for a product that they have previously
    purchased.
14. When reviewing products, the user is unable to upload
    photos or videos as part of their review.
15. Multiple orders are often delivered by multiple different
    drivers instead of bundling orders for the same delivery
    address together with the same driver.

## Amazon South Africa

### Pros

1. Prices are often much lower than Takealot.
2. Collection points use Pudo Lockers (powered by The Courier
   Guy), and there are many around me, which makes collections
   much more convenient.
3. Order items can be cancelled before the order is packed.
4. The deals page has a progress bar that shows the percentage
   of deals claimed.
5. If the user clicks through to a product page for a product
   that they have previously purchased, the page product page
   will display the date that the product was previously
   purchased, which is useful for accidentally purchasing the
   same product more than once.
6. When reviewing products, the user is able to upload a photo
   or video as part of their review.
7. When browsing products in wish lists, there is an option for
   the user to browse all of their wish lists at once, instead
   of having to browse them one by one.

### Cons

1.  Some of the items that I ordered arrived with
    broken or damaged boxes, or even boxes that had been opened
    which is especially unacceptable when purchasing gifts.
2.  Some items are packed into soft courier bags instead of
    boxes, which causes items to be damaged by the couriers.
3.  Liquids aren't packaged properly and get packaged with
    other items on the same order and then leak onto those
    items.
4.  There are products that have incorrect or deceptive images
    on the product pages, which is very misleading.
5.  Prices are not visible when browsing through the deals
    pages.  The user has to click though to the product page
    for each item to view the price of that specific item.
6.  Some deals have a product limit per customer, for example
    only a quantity of 2 of the specific item may be purchased
    at the deal price.
7.  Some products are categorised incorrectly into the incorrect
    product category.
8.  The navigation on both the website and mobile app are very
    buggy and they both jump and make the user lose track of
    where they were while trying to scroll through the 
    deals pages.
9.  The UI of the page to cancel order items is hideous,
    and only allows the user to cancel the entire quantity
    instead of allowing the user to specify the quantity that
    they want to cancel.
10. The general UI and UX are very dated and not user-friendly
    at all.
11. The user has to fight with the packaging tape to remove it
    from the boxes.
12. The product review process seems to be manual, so it takes
    a long time for product reviews to be approved.
13. Delivery drivers often request the user to sign for the
    delivery even though a PIN is already required in order
    to accept delivery.
14. Delivery drivers drive off if the user does not hear them
    hooting, and also do not give the user sufficient time to
    meet them before driving off.
15. Delivery handover is slow and inefficient and requires
    a lot of patience most of the time.

## Conclusion

- Takealot is generally a far superior experience.
- Amazon South Africa has far more competitive pricing,
  for their daily and Black Friday deals if you get there
  early enough before the deal gets sold out.
